# CMSE 890-602 Fall 2024
Welcome to the course page for Reproducible Computational Workflows, a CMSE course at MSU.

Computational workflows are at the heart of scientific research in fields from high energy physics to textual analysis in the humanities. As the amount of science we do grows, reproducibility becomes ever more important. This course will introduce you to the concepts of computational workflows as applied to research, from the basics of design and planning, through development best practices, and finally the application of cutting edge software packages to research problems.

The primary topics covered in this course include:

- Introduction to workflows
- Git, GitHub and version control
- Code design and style
- Testing and documentation
- Code review
- Data formats, tables and databases
- Modular workflows, related software and development
- Portable workflows and related software

Required skills:

- Be able to use the Unix command line to do basic operations (creating and changing directories, listing their contents, creating, deleting, and moving files, and so forth).
- Be able to program comfortably in a programming language used for scripting such as Python or R.
